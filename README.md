## Description

**How does it work 💻**
>
> This application allows you to monitor current information about films, actors, and other people involved in their creation. All data comes from TMDB. The main page contains popular films with pagination, allowing you to navigate between pages. Clicking on a film's tile will allow you to access its details. Using the search engine on the main page and on the subpage containing details, you can search for the film you're interested in. The next tab is "Popular People," which works almost identically to the main page – you can also access details, this time about a specific person. The search engine will guide you to the people you're interested in.

**Methods and aims 🧐**
>
> This app was created as part of a group project aimed at learning how to work in a team according to Scrum, using pull requests and reviews on GitHub. We worked in a team of three, each creating a branch, which we then merged with main only after the other two people agreed.
>
**How it's built ⚒️**
>
> Pages:
> - Movies Page, a page contains information about popular films, their ratings, genres, and release year. Includes pagination to navigate to the next page and a search engine that allows you to find a movie by name.
> - Movie Page, a subpage of Movies Page, contains backdrop, details with a description of the film, cast and crew. Includes a search engine that allows you to find a movie by name.
> - People Page, a page contains pictures and names of currently most popular people. Includes pagination to navigate to the next page and a search engine that allows you to find a person by name.
> - Person Page, a subpage of Movies Page, contains details with a biography of the person, films in which he or she acted and in which she participated as a crew member. Includes a search engine that allows you to find a person by name.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
